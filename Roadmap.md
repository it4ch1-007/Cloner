## Cloner Roadmap


- LOGGING:
    - First of all we will have to log all the activities that we want to specify inside the system.
- Loading the file using Windows API.
- We will not be working on various feature options as the tool will be gui based.
- This will be working for both linux and windows systems.
- Linux: Access the dev/
- This will be for the malwares or malicious spywares that donot act until and unless a network is established with the attacker but here we will send any random response to the victim's system such that it will be intercepted as a response from the attacker side. This will give us the requests that it is trying to give to the attacker online and its domain name system.
- All the requests will be intercepted and analysed.
#### They can be intercepted as malicious or not and can be flagged likewise.
- A sample fake input and response has to be sent to the victim's system.


### ACTION
- First we have to identify the tyoe of listener (HTTP,TCP,UDP).
    HTTP Response:
        - The header should be in the same format as the request.
    TCP Response 
        -Sockets will be used.
- It should have a feature of sending custom made resoonses to the victim's system.
